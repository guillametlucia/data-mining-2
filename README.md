This study explores advancements in information retrieval systems, with a focus on ranking mechanisms beyond the traditional Best
Match 25 (BM25) model. I implement and evaluate three contemporary models: logistic regression with word embeddings, LambdaMART, and a transformer-based Large Language Model (BERT),
comparing their performance against BM25 on a validation dataset.
